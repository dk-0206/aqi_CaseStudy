\# Forecasting Delhi AQI Using Machine Learning



\## Overview

This is an academic machine learning case study developed for end-semester practical evaluation.

The project focuses on forecasting daily Air Quality Index (AQI) levels in Delhi using historical data.



\## Data

\- Source: Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)

\- Monitoring Stations: ITO, Anand Vihar

\- Time Period: 2017–2023

\- Granularity: Daily AQI



\## Methodology

\- Time-series regression with time-based train-test split

\- Feature engineering for seasonality and temporal dependence

\- Error analysis for extreme AQI days



\## Models Used

\- Linear Regression

\- Random Forest Regressor



\## Evaluation Metrics

\- MAE, RMSE



\## Key Outcome

Tree-based models outperform linear models, but extreme AQI events remain difficult to predict.



\## Notes

This project is intended for academic and educational purposes.
